## Known Issue

* Sometimes icon in location bar is disabled. - fixed at Firefox 64.

I had issued on bugzilla.mozilla.org, and seeing how it goes.
[1493470 - pageAction icon goes hidden respond to a cross-site domain's movie inside iframe](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1493470)

* I want to do `5 j` as on Vim.

That is impossible, at least by WebExtensions own.
twitter's javascript maybe checks whether each keyevent's `isTrusted` property.
So, if this addon dispatches keydown event for `j` key from content script, 
it results in `isTrusted` as `false` and a event is ignored by twitter's javascript,
and some post processes (to move forward selected tweet, or so) never be fired.
For `true`, I guess that we need to have browser to fire keyevent, 
but WebExtensions API does not have such an ability.
